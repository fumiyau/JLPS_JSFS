Replication files for my publication on income inequality among married couples, focusing on a couple’s educational pairing and the wife’s labor market participation.

There are 6 do files (+master fofile) to run the replication.

0.Master.do - a do file that runs other do files

1.DataConst-Wide - a do file that creates dataset for analysis in wide format

2.DataConst-Long - a do file that creates dataset for analysis in long format

3.Analysis - a do file that provides analysis results

This study used JLPS wave 1-7 (Japanese Life-course Panel Study), and now (September 2018) wave 8 is available.

I used sav file as raw data and converted it to dta format.
